    "sampleAnswer": "My debugging approach follows a systematic process. First, I reproduce the issue consistently and gather as much information as possible - error logs, user reports, and system metrics. Then I isolate the problem by examining recent changes and using debugging tools like browser dev tools or server logs. I use techniques like binary search to narrow down the cause, adding logging or breakpoints as needed. Once I identify the root cause, I implement a fix and write tests to prevent regression. Throughout the process, I document my findings and communicate progress to stakeholders.",

Common examples include classification (predicting categories) and regression (predicting continuous values). Unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data to discover hidden patterns or structures. Examples include clustering (grouping similar data points) and dimensionality reduction. You'd use supervised learning when you have labeled examples and want to predict outcomes, while unsupervised learning is useful for exploratory analysis and finding unknown patterns in data.",

Based on these insights, I'd prioritize improvements using a framework like RICE (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort). For example, if data shows users struggle with onboarding, I'd focus on simplifying the initial experience. I'd implement A/B tests for new features, track key metrics like DAU, retention rates, and feature adoption, and iterate based on results.

Then I'd analyze the market share decline through several lenses: market factors (is the overall market growing or shrinking?), competitive factors (new entrants, competitive actions), and company-specific factors (product quality, pricing, distribution). I'd look at customer segments to see if decline is broad-based or concentrated. For root cause analysis, I'd examine the customer journey and value proposition compared to competitors.

RESTful APIs are stateless, meaning each request contains all information needed to process it. They use HTTP methods like GET (retrieve data), POST (create), PUT (update), and DELETE (remove) to perform operations on resources identified by URLs. REST APIs return standard HTTP status codes (200 for success, 404 for not found, etc.) and typically use JSON for data exchange. I'd use REST APIs for web applications, mobile apps, and microservices because they're simple, scalable, and work well with existing web infrastructure.

For missing data, I determine if it's missing at random and choose appropriate handling methods - imputation, exclusion, or flagging.
